Project Description: Landslide Detection Using IoT (ESP32)

Landslides are one of the most destructive natural disasters, often occurring without sufficient warning and causing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic losses. This project aims to develop an IoT-based Landslide Detection and Early Warning System using an ESP32 microcontroller and various environmental sensors. The goal is to create a low-cost, real-time monitoring solution that can detect early signs of soil movement and unstable terrain.

The system continuously monitors critical geological and environmental parameters such as soil moisture, vibration, tilt/ground displacement, rainfall intensity, and humidity/temperature. These values help identify conditions that typically precede a landslide. The collected sensor data is processed by the ESP32 and transmitted to a cloud platform (such as  MQTT server, or ThingsBoard) via WiFi for real-time visualization and analysis.

If abnormal readings are detected—such as excessive soil moisture, strong ground vibration, or a sudden change in slope angle—the system triggers an early warning alert. Alerts can be sent via mobile app, web dashboard, SMS, or buzzer/alarm to warn nearby communities or authorities.

The project demonstrates how IoT technology can enhance disaster preparedness by providing continuous monitoring, early detection, and timely warnings. Its low cost and scalability make it suitable for deployment in landslide-prone regions, particularly in rural or hilly areas.
